I'm a graduate student in [APRILab](https://aprilab.mae.ufl.edu/) at the [University of Florida](https://ufl.edu), advised by Assistant Professor [Jane Shin](https://mae.ufl.edu/people/faculty/primary/profiles/jane-jaejeong-shin/). I am also involved in the Machine Intelligence Lab [(MIL)](http://subjugator.org/), where I have worked in the mechanical and software team for five years. I have also had a couple of [internship positions](https://andrespulido8.github.io/industry_experiences/) in the autonomous vehicle industry.

Previously, I earned my Bachelor's and Master's Degree in Mechanical Engineering also from University of Florida in May 2021 and May 2023 respectively.
